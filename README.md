# mr-boxington-action

Set up [mr boxington](https://github.com/jdx/mr-boxington) and use its local
store directly or back it with GitHub Actions cache or an mbx-compatible server. When
`version` is omitted, the action uses `mbx` from `PATH` and downloads the latest
release only when it is absent. Setting `version` always installs that release.

To use an independently verified executable without installing or downloading
mbx, supply `mbx-path` (an absolute executable path) and `expected-version`
(an exact version such as `1.12.0`) together. The action requires the exact
`mbx 1.12.0` version banner and fails if the executable is missing, inaccessible,
or mismatched. These inputs cannot be combined with `version`. The external
executable is never restored from or copied into a target cache, and is verified
again before a saving post step, including its original SHA-256 digest.

For an mbx executable supporting the owner comparison API, GitHub `objects`
mode accepts a fresh absolute `comparison-state` path inside `RUNNER_TEMP`,
outside the transported cache. Preexisting paths and symlinks are rejected;
the recorded baseline must retain its original SHA-256 digest until post.
The action probes the API before restore, records the restored bundle's owner
inventory before import, and requires that baseline in post. Cold restores use
an explicit empty owner baseline. Export reports `useful_delta` and a semantic
digest: unchanged owner state skips upload; useful state saves under
`${primaryKey}-${semantic_digest}`. A malformed report fails closed. Optional
import, export, or upload failures warn without changing the build outcome;
executable verification and comparison capability failures remain fatal.

## Local filesystem

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v7
  - uses: jdx/mr-boxington-action@v1
    with:
      backend: local
  - run: mbx test --workspace
```

The local backend installs or reuses mbx and leaves its store on the filesystem without
configuring a remote transport or an upload/download phase. This is useful on
persistent runners and with volume actions that mount mbx's cache directory.

## GitHub Actions cache

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read

steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v7
  - uses: jdx/mr-boxington-action@v1
  - run: mbx test --workspace
```

The default backend restores Cargo's pruned target directory and registry from
the previous compatible build on every run, so a job that changes a few files
recompiles only those crates. It saves a new immutable entry for pushes to the
repository's default branch and, when `save-on-workflow-dispatch` is enabled,
trusted `workflow_dispatch` runs. Pull requests—including forks—are
restore-only.

The action disables mbx-managed target views and native-link object caching so
it can transport the in-place `target` tree without also transporting mbx's
object cache. The post step removes final products and unrelated Cargo state
before saving, while retaining fingerprints, dependencies, build-script state,
and the registry. Full mbx executables used by build-script shims, including
legacy hard-linked copies, are omitted from transport and rehydrated from the
installed mbx after restore; tiny launchers and Cargo freshness timestamps
remain intact. When `version` pins an exact release, the archive also carries
one mbx executable so later warm jobs avoid a separate release download.

The earlier `objects` payload is still available for workflows whose builds
must share across differing target directories or checkout layouts:

```yaml
- uses: jdx/mr-boxington-action@v1
  with:
    github-cache-mode: objects
- run: mbx test --workspace
```

That mode imports the restored bundle before any build steps and exports the
deduplicated closure of every completed `mbx` command in the job afterward,
assigning a unique `MBX_CACHE_EXPORT_GROUP` automatically. Its entries are
smaller because they omit the Cargo registry, which Cargo then downloads again
inside the build; in paired measurements on GitHub-hosted runners it restored
and built a small edit roughly ten seconds slower than the `target` payload.

From mbx 1.12.0 the bundle is a directory instead of a tar. `actions/cache`
archives whatever path it is given, so a tar meant every byte was written twice
on restore: once when the cache action unpacked its own archive, and again when
the importer unpacked the tar inside it. The importer now reads the restored
tree in place. On a warm restore of a 4,071-object closure this took
`mbx cache import` from 6.5s to 2.0s, against roughly 1.3s more spent inside
the cache action's own restore, which handles many files less quickly than one
archive. Earlier mbx versions keep the tar form. The two use separate cache
keys, so the first job after an mbx version crosses 1.12.0 restores cold.

On GitHub-hosted runners, `objects` mode sets `MBX_GC_AUTO=0` for the job unless
that environment variable is already set. This prevents mbx's local disk budget
from immediately evicting a large restored bundle. The cache can grow during
the job; set `MBX_GC_AUTO=1` in the job's environment to keep automatic cleanup.
Self-hosted and unrecognized runners retain their existing GC policy. For a
disposable self-hosted runner, set `MBX_GC_AUTO=0` in the job's environment to
opt into the same behavior.

The generated cache key includes the identity of the `rustc` on `PATH`
(a hash of `rustc -vV`, the same identity Swatinem/rust-cache keys on). mbx
keys every cached compilation on the compiler, so a store built by one
toolchain matches nothing under another; scoping the key keeps each toolchain
on its own cache instead of restoring one that can no longer produce hits—
which otherwise happens whenever a runner image updates its preinstalled Rust.
Install your toolchain **before** this action so the key sees the compiler the
build will use; without a `rustc` on `PATH` the segment is the literal
`norust`.

A build that names its toolchain on its own command line is the one case the
probe cannot see: `mbx +1.91 check` compiles with 1.91 while `rustc` on `PATH`
still reports the default, so the 1.91 store lands under the default
toolchain's key and the two share an entry. Name it with `toolchain` and the
key follows it:

```yaml
- uses: jdx/mr-boxington-action@v1
  with:
    toolchain: "1.91"
- run: mbx +1.91 check --workspace
```

`toolchain` scopes the cache key only — it neither installs the toolchain nor
selects it for the build.
An explicitly named toolchain that cannot report its identity fails the action;
install that toolchain before invoking the action.

On Linux, the action also enables mbx's native link cache. This avoids relinking
eligible test binaries and executables on a warm build. Set `cache-links: false`
to opt out, or `cache-links: true` to opt in explicitly on another supported
platform.

The action accepts a resolved version only when GitHub reports that release as
immutable and supplies an asset digest. Release metadata requests use
`GITHUB_TOKEN` when set and otherwise use the `github-token` input; either requires
`contents: read` permission.

Change `cache-generation` when a cache-format or policy change should start
fresh:

```yaml
- uses: jdx/mr-boxington-action@v1
  with:
    version: 0.3.0
    cache-generation: v2
```

When the Cargo workspace is not at the checkout root, point `working-directory`
at it so the `target` payload caches that workspace's `target/` and prunes it
against its own `cargo metadata`:

```yaml
- uses: jdx/mr-boxington-action@v1
  with:
    working-directory: rust
- run: mbx test --workspace
  working-directory: rust
```

`cache-key` and newline-separated `restore-keys` are available when the default
`${platform}-${architecture}-mbx-${generation}-${toolchain}-${commit}` layout
is not enough.

## Cache server

With OIDC:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write

steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v7
  - uses: jdx/mr-boxington-action@v1
    with:
      backend: server
      server-url: https://cache.example.com
      namespace: acme/backend
      oidc-audience: mbx-cache
  - run: mbx build --workspace --all-features
```

Or pass a secret bearer token:

```yaml
- uses: jdx/mr-boxington-action@v1
  with:
    backend: server
    server-url: https://cache.example.com
    namespace: acme/backend
    token: ${{ secrets.MBX_REMOTE_TOKEN }}
```

The action exports the corresponding `MBX_REMOTE_*` variables for subsequent
steps. mbx itself reduces pull requests and unprotected branches to read-only
and disables the remote on tags and releases. The server must still enforce its
own authorization policy.

`save-on-workflow-dispatch` is intended for explicitly trusted cache-seeding
and benchmark workflows. Pull requests and pushes to non-default branches
remain restore-only even when the input is set. Pair it with a new
`cache-generation` when an mbx upgrade changes cache behavior. Each saving
dispatch restores the latest compatible cache and writes its learned state to
a new immutable key for the next dispatch.

## Outputs

- `mbx-version` — installed version.
- `cache-hit` — `true` for an exact GitHub cache-key match.
- `cache-primary-key` — key used by the GitHub backend.
