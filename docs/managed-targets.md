# Managed target directories

Cargo normally writes build outputs to `<workspace>/target`. Deleting a
worktree deletes useful outputs, while abandoning a checkout leaves gigabytes
behind indefinitely.

Managed targets are enabled by default. The first build is enough:

```sh
mbx build
```

mbx places the target directory under its cache root and leaves a symlink at
`target`, so familiar paths continue to work:

```text
target -> <cache root>/targets/v1/<checkout digest>
```

A checkout that already has a real `target/` has it moved there on its first
mbx build, with its outputs kept. See
[Adoption during a build](#adoption-during-a-build).

Cargo continues to report artifacts through the workspace's `target` path, so
debugger launch configurations do not capture the private managed path that
collection may later replace. In a Git checkout, mbx also adds the exact link
path to `.git/info/exclude` when necessary. A directory-only `target/` pattern
does not match a symlink; the local exclude keeps `git status` clean without
changing the project's `.gitignore`.

## When mbx leaves a target alone

mbx does not override an explicit target directory supplied by:

- `--target-dir`
- `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`
- Cargo's `build.target-dir` configuration

## Checks run beside builds {#check-lanes}

Cargo locks a target directory while it compiles, so a `cargo clippy` started
next to a `cargo build` waits for the build to finish. In a managed target,
`check` and `clippy` write to a directory of their own inside it, so the two
run at the same time with nothing to configure:

```sh
mbx build &
mbx clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

```text
target/            (linked to the managed target)
├── debug/         build, test, run
└── check/debug/   check, clippy
```

Aliases count: `mbx c`, and an alias such as `chk = "check"`, get the lane too.
Builds keep writing to `target/debug`, so binaries stay where they always were.
Both commands share one compile budget and one cache, so the second starts
with whatever the first has already stored. The `check` directory is part of
the managed target: it is collected, moved, and removed with it.

The first `check` or `clippy` in a checkout after upgrading compiles into the
new directory rather than reusing `target/debug`. The cache restores most of
it. Proc macros and build scripts, which Cargo compiles for both, exist once in
each directory.

mbx leaves a command alone, and it uses `target/` as before, when:

- the target directory is set by `--target-dir`, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, or
  `build.target-dir`;
- Cargo's build directory is set at all, with `build.build-dir`,
  `CARGO_BUILD_BUILD_DIR`, or `--config`, because that is where the lock lives
  and a lane cannot move it;
- mbx is not placing the target, for example in CI or with
  `target.views = false`.

Set `target.lanes = false` (`MBX_TARGET_LANES=0`) to keep every command in
`target/`. Two builds, or a build and a test run, still share `target/debug`
and wait for each other; give them separate targets as described in
[Parallel builds](/scheduling).

## Change target placement

Set `target.root` to place managed targets on another local disk:

```sh
mbx settings set target.root /path/to/local/build-targets
```

After any builds using the old target have finished, the next build can update
an mbx-owned `target` link to the new managed location:

- When the old directory can be renamed to the new location, mbx moves it and
  preserves its outputs.
- When a rename fails, including across filesystems, mbx creates the destination
  and removes the old directory. It does not copy the old outputs. Matching
  compilations can be restored from the shared cache; other work compiles again.

The old collection record is retired after relocation. The target budget
scales with the destination disk unless you set it explicitly.

## Adopt existing target directories {#existing-target-directories}

Use `mbx adopt` to bring existing `target/` directories under mbx management
without deleting their contents. mbx moves each directory under the managed
root and leaves a link at its original path. From then on, Cargo continues to
use `target/`, while mbx applies the same collection policy as it does to any
other managed target.

Adopt the current checkout, name specific checkouts, or search below one or
more directories:

```sh
mbx adopt                            # the current checkout
mbx adopt ~/src/project              # one checkout
mbx adopt --recursive ~/src          # checkouts anywhere below a directory
mbx adopt --recursive --dry-run ~/src
```

Use `--dry-run` to see which directories are eligible without moving them.
Each adopted result includes the logical size of the directory, a skipped
checkout reports only why it was left alone, and runs over multiple checkouts
end with a total:

```text
adopted /home/me/src/project/target (2.4 GiB logical)
adopted /home/me/src/other/target (912.0 MiB logical)
adopted 2 target directories (3.3 GiB logical)
```

Recursive searches look for directories containing both `Cargo.toml` and a
real `target/`. They do not descend into hidden directories, `target/`
directories, or symbolic links.

### Adoption during a build

A build that finds an existing real `target/` moves it under the managed root
the same way and keeps its outputs:

```text
mbx[cache]: moved the existing target/ directory under the managed root (2.4 GiB logical)
```

This happens with or without a terminal, so builds run by agents and scripts
adopt too. CI builds leave `target/` in place, because a CI cache step that
saves `target/` would save only the link. If Cargo is still writing to the
directory, the build continues in it and a later build moves it. Set
`target.views = false` to keep every `target/` where Cargo puts it.

If the managed root is on another filesystem, mbx cannot rename the directory
into it. An interactive build then offers to remove the old outputs instead,
with “Keep it” selected by default. Non-interactive builds never remove a
directory, and the `mbx adopt` command never deletes or copies one.

### Eligibility and recovery

mbx leaves a checkout unchanged and explains why when:

- `--target-dir`, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, or Cargo's `build.target-dir` names the
  target directory;
- it is a workspace member, whose outputs live in the workspace root's
  `target/`;
- managed targets are turned off for it;
- its `target/` is on a different filesystem from the managed root, where a
  rename would require copying;
- `target/` is already a symbolic link.

Set `target.root` to a location on the same filesystem when you want to adopt
a directory that would otherwise be skipped. Before moving one, mbx takes its
Cargo build locks; if a build is still writing there, `mbx adopt` refuses the
move and asks you to try again later. It then renames the directory into the
managed root before creating the link. If the link or collection record cannot
be created, mbx moves the directory back. When a user accepts the build-time
removal option, mbx deletes the old outputs only after their managed
replacement is ready.

Adoption preserves the files already in `target/`, but it does not make every
plain Cargo artifact immediately reusable by mbx. Cargo keys builds run
through mbx differently, so the first mbx build may compile artifacts that
were produced without mbx. A target directory previously built through mbx
remains fresh after adoption.

## Start new checkouts from existing units

With Cargo 1.100 or later, the first build of a profile in a new checkout
copies the registry and Git dependency units that another checkout's managed
target already built. Cargo treats the copies as fresh and skips those units,
so the build compiles or restores only what differs:

```text
mbx[target]: copied 302 registry build units from /home/me/src/project
```

mbx tries other managed targets, most recently used first, and copies from the
first one with units for this checkout's dependencies. It copies only the units
that profile's latest build read. The same profile below each target triple
the other checkout built is copied too, so a target chosen in Cargo
configuration is covered. Copies are reflinks where the filesystem supports
them. mbx skips this step when:

- the profile already has a `build/` directory in this checkout;
- the Cargo running this build is older than 1.100;
- a build holds the Cargo lock of either profile;
- no other checkout was built by Cargo 1.100 or later.

Path dependencies and workspace members are never copied. Cargo trusts their
source modification times, so a copied unit could pass as fresh with another
checkout's contents. Copied units this checkout does not use are removed by
[collection](#unused-build-units). Turn copying off for one command with
`MBX_TARGET_SEED=0`, or from then on with:

```sh
mbx settings set target.seed false
```

## Collection

mbx records the checkout associated with each target view. Collection runs
after a build, at most once an hour, and needs no configuration. It normally
runs in the background once the build has returned, so a walk of every managed
directory never holds up the build that happened to come due, and the next
build reports what it removed. If the background collector cannot be started,
the build collects in the foreground instead.

Every command you run through mbx, such as `mbx test`, `mbx run`, or
`mbx nextest run`, holds a shared lease on its target directory from start to
exit. Collection does not remove a directory while any command holds its lease.
`mbx gc` and the next build's report list such directories as kept, for
example `kept 1 target directories in use by running commands`. The lease ends
when the mbx process exits or is killed, and the usual rules below then apply.
The lease does not protect:

- a binary you start directly from `target/` in a separate command, including
  test binaries built earlier with `--no-run`;
- Cargo run directly, without mbx, through the `target` link, which is
  protected only while Cargo holds its build lock;
- a child process that keeps running after its mbx process alone was killed.
  Ctrl-C stops the whole process group, so it ends the command and its lease
  together.

A target directory is removed when any of these is true:

- Its checkout is gone. This happens regardless of the limits below.
- It has gone unused for `target.max_age`, 30 days by default. The next build
  in that checkout can restore matching cached outputs. Evicted or unsupported
  work must compile again.
- The managed directories together exceed `target.max_size`. The least
  recently used go first. The most recently used directory is never collected
  for being over budget; if the budget cannot be met without it, mbx says so
  and keeps it.
- The disk is low on space. See [When the disk runs low](#when-the-disk-runs-low).

Cached compilations shared with a live checkout remain protected throughout.
[Keep or evict specific checkouts](#keep-or-evict-specific-checkouts) changes
the order for checkouts you list.

### Unused build units

A checkout in regular use keeps its target directory, but Cargo leaves the
previous build units behind whenever a lockfile update, feature change, or
toolchain update moves its builds on to new ones. Collection also removes
those units once no build has used them for `target.max_age` plus a day:

- With Cargo 1.100 or later, each unit is its own directory,
  `<profile>/build/<package>/<hash>/`, and each is removed on its own.
- Earlier Cargo versions spread units across `deps/`, `.fingerprint/`, and
  `build/`. mbx removes that layout as a whole once no build has used any of
  it, which happens after a checkout moves to Cargo 1.100.

Cargo reads the fingerprint of every unit a build uses, even when there is
nothing to compile, and mbx judges use by that read's access time. The extra
day covers Linux's default `relatime`, which refreshes an access time at most
daily. mbx skips this step when the filesystem does not record access times,
as under `noatime`, and leaves a target directory alone while a build holds
its Cargo lock. The next build that needs a removed unit restores it from the
cache or compiles it again. Unused units go before the size budget is weighed,
so they are removed ahead of whole target directories. `target.max_age =
"none"` keeps them.

### Budgets scale with the disk

All three budgets scale with the disk that holds the data. By default, targets,
learned incremental state, and the action store share the cache disk. A custom
`target.root` uses its own volume for the target budget:

| Budget | Default | Bounds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gc.max_size` (action store) | 5% of the disk | 5 GiB to 500 GiB |
| `target.max_size` (managed targets) | 10% of the disk | 10 GiB to 100 GiB |
| `gc.incremental_max_size` (learned incremental) | 5% of the disk | 10 GiB to 100 GiB |

Scaled budgets are rounded down to a whole 5 GiB. When the disk cannot be
measured, mbx uses 20 GiB, 30 GiB, and 20 GiB respectively. An explicit budget
overrides these defaults, and `mbx gc --dry-run` previews the effect of a policy
without deleting anything.

### Keep or evict specific checkouts

`target.keep` lists checkouts whose targets are never collected for age or
size, and whose unused build units are left alone. A kept target is still
removed when its checkout is gone. `target.evict_first` lists checkouts whose
targets go before any other when the managed targets are over budget:

```sh
mbx settings set target.keep '~/src/app'
mbx settings set target.evict_first .claude/worktrees
```

An absolute entry, or one starting with `~`, covers the checkouts at or under
that directory. A relative entry matches wherever its components appear
together in a checkout's path, so `.claude/worktrees` covers the worktrees
coding agents create under `.claude/worktrees` in any repository.

When both lists match a checkout, the entry that names more of its path wins.
With the example above, `~/src/app` is kept and its agent worktrees under
`~/src/app/.claude/worktrees` are evicted first. A tie keeps.

Evict-first targets are collected least recently used first, ahead of the rest.
The most recently used target directory is still spared, whichever list it is
on. Kept targets count toward `target.max_size`, so the other checkouts' targets
make room for them. `mbx settings set` and the environment variables take
comma-separated lists: `mbx settings set target.evict_first .claude/worktrees,scratch`
or `MBX_TARGET_EVICT_FIRST=.claude/worktrees,scratch`.

### When the disk runs low

The budgets above are shares of the disk's size, so they hold even when
something else fills the disk. `gc.min_free_size` sets how much free space mbx
tries to keep: by default 10% of the disk, from 5 GiB to 50 GiB. The cache disk
and a custom `target.root` volume are each measured against their own size.

While a disk has less free space than that, collection runs as often as every
5 minutes instead of once per `gc.interval`. It does not wait for a build to
finish: a compilation that misses the cache checks the disk when it is done
and starts collection in the background. Collection frees the shortfall from
private state and shared cache data regardless of the budgets:

1. Learned incremental state and generated source trees, least recently used
   first.
2. Managed target directories, least recently used first, with
   `target.evict_first` checkouts ahead of the rest and `target.keep` checkouts
   left alone.
3. Shared action-store objects on the cache disk, after the private state and
   managed targets stop freeing bytes.

The most recently used target directory, and anything a running mbx command
is using, is kept as usual. The shared action store can go below `gc.max_size`
when the cache disk is short, because keeping the build machine usable takes
precedence over retaining every shared result. If collection cannot free
enough, mbx logs a warning and leaves the rest to you. The next build reports
what was removed and why:

```text
mbx[gc]: 3.1 GiB free on the disk holding /home/me/.cache/mbx, under the 25.0 GiB minimum; collecting private state and managed targets past their budgets, then shared cache objects if the cache disk is short
mbx[gc]: removed 4 target directories (18.2 GiB logical, 0 abandoned and 4 live); 6.0 GiB logical remain
mbx[gc]: evicted 12 shared cache objects and 3 action results below gc.max_size because the disk was under gc.min_free_size (2.0 GiB logical freed)
```

Restored outputs that share blocks with the cache through reflinks free less
disk than their logical size, so collection measures the disk again before
each step rather than trusting the logical total. The low-disk loop is bounded
so unrelated files filling the disk cannot make a sweep run forever. Set
`gc.min_free_size` to a size such as `"20GiB"`, or to `"none"` to collect by
the budgets alone.
`mbx gc --dry-run` shows the most a low disk could remove: it cannot measure
what each step would free, so a real run may remove fewer target directories.

### Changing or disabling the limits

For one setting covering all managed build data, use `gc.max_total_size` alone:

```toml
[gc]
max_total_size = "50GiB"
```

This replaces implicit component size caps with a shared logical-byte budget.
Explicit component caps still apply. See [single cache budget](/configuration#single-cache-budget)
for allocation order, protected state, and physical-space limitations. The
following example instead sets advanced overrides:

```toml
[target]
max_size = "60GiB"
max_age = "none"   # keep live checkouts' outputs indefinitely

[gc]
# Optional: one budget covering targets, learned incremental, and the action store.
max_total_size = "50GiB"
incremental_max_size = "20GiB"
incremental_max_age = "30d"
min_free_size = "20GiB"
```

`"none"` turns off `target.max_size`, `target.max_age`,
`gc.incremental_max_size`, `gc.incremental_max_age`, `gc.max_total_size`, or
`gc.min_free_size`.
Invalid sizes and durations are errors, so a typo cannot disable collection.
`gc.max_size` does not accept `"none"`; the action store is always bounded. To
stop creating managed targets, see
[Disable managed targets](#disable-managed-targets).

## Inspect and clean up

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `mbx cache stats` | Inspect the action store, managed targets, and learned incremental state |
| `mbx gc --dry-run` | Preview collection under the configured budgets |
| `mbx gc` | Collect eligible targets, cached objects, and learned incremental state |
| `mbx clean` | Remove this workspace's managed target, link, and learned incremental state |
| `mbx adopt [--recursive] [PATH]...` | Adopt existing `target/` directories without deleting their contents |
| `mbx cache remove /path/to/workspace` | Remove the target and incremental state, then forget that workspace's cache claims |

`mbx clean` and `mbx cache remove` keep the target directory, with a warning,
while a command run through mbx is using it. `mbx clean` also accepts a
workspace path. It keeps shared cached objects and the workspace's cache
claims, so a later build can restore matching outputs. `mbx cache remove`
forgets those claims as well; objects used by other workspaces remain available
and normal garbage collection reclaims unneeded objects.

Cargo's `cargo clean` follows Cargo's own target-directory behavior and does not
remove mbx's private incremental state.

## Disable managed targets

Set `MBX_TARGET_VIEWS=0` for one command, or turn placement off from then on:

```sh
mbx settings set target.views false
```

Turning placement off does not delete a target directory mbx already manages.
The existing `target` link continues to work, and collection can still reclaim
the directory after its checkout disappears.

Use the [cleanup commands](#inspect-and-clean-up) to remove existing managed
outputs immediately.

::: warning Windows
Creating the link requires Developer Mode or a privileged process on Windows.
If Windows cannot create it, mbx lets Cargo use its ordinary target directory.
:::

## Collection byte counts

Collection reports **logical bytes**: the sum of removed file lengths. The
`removed_bytes` and `remaining_bytes` fields in `mbx gc --json` use this measure;
`byte_accounting: "logical"` identifies it explicitly. The lifetime `savings`
object in `mbx stats --json` also carries that marker. Lifetime savings totals
and cleanup messages use the same measure. Existing `freed_*_bytes` fields in
the saved lifetime tally retain their names for compatibility.

Physical disk space released can differ. Reflinks and hard links may leave data
referenced by another file; sparse files may occupy fewer blocks than their
length. Filesystem snapshots and delayed allocation also affect reclamation.
These counters do not estimate physical space released.
