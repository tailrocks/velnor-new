# Cache results

Use the build summary to see what mbx restored, compiled, or left uncached.
Counts describe the compiler actions and cached build-script runs observed by
mbx; they do not include work Cargo skipped because its outputs were already
fresh. Each lookup ends as one hit or one miss, so the two add up to the
lookup count. Under `MBX_VERIFY=1` a lookup that finds a result ends as a
verification instead.

```sh
mbx explain --last          # inspect the most recent recorded build
MBX_SUMMARY=full mbx build  # print a detailed report for a new build
```

| Outcome | Cache lookup? | Result stored? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Hit](#hit) | Found a result | Already stored |
| [Miss](#miss) | No matching result | After successful compilation |
| [Not looked up](#could-not-look-up) | No usable input prediction yet | After successful compilation |
| [Bypass](#bypass) | Skipped | No shared result |

## Measure cache reuse

Running the same command twice in the same target directory often measures
Cargo's freshness check: no compiler work is needed. To observe mbx reuse,
build equivalent source with the same toolchain, profile, and features into
two fresh target directories:

```sh
mbx build --target-dir target/cache-demo-first
mbx build --target-dir target/cache-demo-second
```

Use directory names that do not already contain build outputs. This keeps your
normal target intact and avoids deleting the shared cache. The second build
can restore work recorded by the first; unsupported actions still run.
These explicit targets are not managed, so remove the two example directories
when you finish. For repeatable timings, use the [benchmark harness](/benchmarks).

Compiler time avoided is summed across actions. It is not elapsed time saved;
always compare wall-clock build time as well as the counters.

## Hit

mbx derived an action key, found its result, and restored the outputs. A hit can
come from the local store or a configured remote.

## Miss

mbx derived a key and looked it up, but no result existed. The compilation ran
and its successful result was stored.

## Could not look up

mbx did not yet have usable dep-info or a prediction from which to derive the
key. This is common on a cold build. The action is still stored after
compilation, so calling it a miss would overstate the number of failed lookups.
The short summary counts these as `not looked up`; the full summary prints a
`could not look up` line with the reason.

## Bypass

mbx recognized that it could not model the action exactly and ran the real
compiler without caching it. The short summary's `bypassed` count leaves out
routine compiler probes (`compiler-query`, `standard-input`, and their `cc-`
counterparts). Reasons are grouped in the full summary (`MBX_SUMMARY=full`);
set `MBX_BYPASS_LOG` to a file path for the per-action record.

Run a Cargo command through `mbx explain` to collect those records temporarily,
group identical causes, and print guidance for every bypass category:

```sh
mbx explain build --workspace
```

```text
cache explanation: 8 compilations bypassed the cache

compiler-query (2)
Expected: Cargo asks rustc for toolchain information; there is no compilation to cache.
  - rustc invocation is a compiler query, not a compilation (2 times)

incremental (5)
Cargo compiled this incrementally, which mbx cannot cache. `mbx settings set incremental false` (or `MBX_INCREMENTAL=0`) makes it cacheable again; mbx already gives a crate you are editing its own incremental state without giving up the rest of the cache.
  - incremental compilation cannot be combined with action caching (5 times)

standard-input (1)
Expected for Cargo probes: source supplied on standard input cannot be rediscovered later.
  - rustc invocation reads source from standard input
```

Categories marked expected are routine compiler probes, with no output to cache; here the
`incremental` group is the one the build could act on. The command preserves
Cargo's exit status after printing the explanation.

Actionable bypasses carry their remediation with the reason that produced
them. For example, links rejected because of `split-debuginfo=packed` point to
the active Cargo profile or `RUSTFLAGS`, while C compilations affected by
`CPATH` name the environment variable to unset.

`mbx explain` also reports cacheability problems that prevent a compilation
from reaching mbx at all. If `CC`, `CXX`, `HOST_CC`, or `HOST_CXX` was already
set when the build began, the report names the variable and value and explains
that host C and C++ compiles are invisible to the cache. These are warnings,
not bypass counts, because mbx never observed the compiler invocations.

## Remote failure

A remote cache request failed and the build continued without that result:
an unreachable host, refused credentials, or an invalid response can all reduce
reuse. Build-time transport failures fall back to local compilation. Invalid
configuration can still stop startup, and explicit `mbx prefetch` and
`mbx doctor` commands report connection failures as errors. The summary
counts them because a remote that is failing every request reports the same
hits, misses, and bytes as one that was empty. The short summary includes the
count inline; the full summary explains it:

```text
mbx[cache]: the remote cache failed 4 of its requests; this build ran without what it could not reach, and the warnings above say why
```

The individual warnings, printed as the build runs, say what failed. The count
also appears as `remote_failures` in the JSON statistics report, so CI can alert
on a cache that has quietly stopped serving.

## Watching a build instead

Everything above describes results reported after a build. To see the same
outcomes as they are decided, one row per compilation with the crate it belongs
to, run [`mbx tui`](/tui) in another terminal. It reads builds using the same
local cache, including ones already running.

## Reading the hit rate

A build can report a high hit rate among attempted lookups while spending most
of its time on actions that were not looked up or were bypassed. Read all the
summary counts together, and compare wall-clock time when evaluating the
cache. Set `MBX_SUMMARY=full` when the one-line counts need a breakdown.

A link mbx cannot describe always runs, so its downstream crates may have work
to do on an otherwise warm build. Native executables, tests, and proc macros on
Linux, macOS, and Windows, host `cdylib`s on Linux, and binaries, tests, and
`cdylib`s for supported self-contained WebAssembly targets may be restored as
hits; see
[limits](/limits#native-linking-is-cached-only-where-the-linker-can-be-described).

## Troubleshooting a low hit rate

Run the build through `mbx explain` first. It collects the per-action
records, groups identical causes, and prints guidance for each category:

```sh
mbx explain build --workspace
```

The usual causes, roughly in the order they show up:

- The store is cold. A first build has no dep-info to derive keys from, so
  "could not look up" can dominate. Compare equivalent builds with fresh
  targets as described [above](#measure-cache-reuse).
- Incremental builds are enabled. With `MBX_INCREMENTAL=1`, workspace
  members compile incrementally, those compilations bypass the cache, and the
  changed artifacts make crates above them miss too. See
  [limits](/limits#incremental-compilations-are-not-cached).
- A link could not be described. Native executables, tests, and proc macros
  are cached on Linux, macOS, and Windows, and self-contained WebAssembly
  targets everywhere, but native links with custom or unmodeled inputs still
  run. A rebuilt dylib can also change the keys of its downstream crates.
  `mbx explain` reports why the link bypassed; see
  [limits](/limits#native-linking-is-cached-only-where-the-linker-can-be-described).
- The inputs differ. A different toolchain, feature set, profile, or
  `RUSTFLAGS` between two checkouts is a different key, and the summary
  reports it as an ordinary miss. Run `mbx explain --last` to replay the most
  recent recorded build and list, per missed crate, the key inputs that
  changed since its last recorded hit. Session history stores hashes, not
  source contents or environment values.
- Build-script output that differs. mbx can share Rust compilations that read
  `OUT_DIR` when the generated output matches across checkouts. A build script
  that embeds the checkout path in its output prevents that reuse. Sharing also
  depends on whether mbx can detect the reference and copy the output;
  `MBX_SHARE_OUT_DIR=0` disables it. See
  [`OUT_DIR` sharing](/limits#out-dir-sharing).
- A build chose its own C compiler, or is cross-compiling. Setting `CC`,
  `HOST_CC`, `CXX`, or `HOST_CXX` leaves host compilations outside mbx.
  Cross-compilations are cached when the build explicitly names a supported
  compiler through `CC_<target>`, `CXX_<target>`, `TARGET_CC`, or `TARGET_CXX`. Bypass kinds beginning `cc-`
  report anything the C adapter declined to model. See
  [limits](/limits#c-and-c-caching-covers-the-host-compiles-mbx-drives).
- CI restored nothing. On GitHub Actions, check that the cache step restored
  an entry; a changed `cache-generation` or a fresh repository starts empty.
  With a remote cache configured, check the [remote failure](#remote-failure)
  count too: a remote that is failing every request reports the same zeros as
  one that is empty.

## Compiler time

The full summary reports real compiler time by outcome and an estimate of
the compiler time avoided by cache hits:

```text
mbx[cache]: compiler time: 4m 12s estimated avoided; 38.20s spent (161 miss in 31.00s, 7 unconsulted in 7.20s)
mbx[cache]: slowest uncached crates: syn 8.90s, regex-syntax 4.90s, serde_derive 3.90s
```

Times of a minute or more are reported in whole units, as above; shorter ones
keep their fraction.

The estimate comes from the duration recorded with the successful compilation
that populated the action prediction; older predictions without a timing hint
contribute zero. The five crates with the largest cumulative uncached compiler
time are listed so you can identify expensive uncached work. Parallel
compilations overlap, so this ranking does not directly identify the critical path.

The JSON statistics report exposes the same data in
`estimated_compiler_duration_avoided_ns`, `compiler`, and
`slow_compilations`.

## Compare transported cache state

The cache owner can record a versioned comparison baseline before an import
consumes its directory bundle:

```sh
mbx cache import --comparison-state baseline.json --json restored-bundle
mbx cache export --group ci --compare baseline.json --json --format directory updated-bundle
```

For a cold miss, `mbx cache comparison-state baseline.json --json` writes an
empty baseline. Keep this file outside the bundle. Export JSON version 1 includes
`useful_delta`, new and changed action-result counts, new prediction counts,
new and changed workspace-variant counts, and a 64-character BLAKE3
`semantic_digest`. A subset of the imported closure is not a useful delta.
Changed results and predictions remain detectable when their counts stay equal.
The digest identifies an inventory; unequal digests alone do not establish a
useful delta.

Workspace comparison includes relative path, entry type, file content digest,
mode, and symlink target. It excludes the external workspace root and filesystem
mtime metadata. Actual scheduler file contents can contain volatile values
(including paths and timestamps); their differences are reported honestly and
are not proof of additional cache hits. Restoration preserves its existing
filesystem timestamps. Comparison requires directory export format. A variant is one complete semantic
workspace inventory; changed variants have a previously known workspace signature.
The owner compares before publication and reports `exported: false` when no useful
delta exists, avoiding closure copying. `mbx cache comparison-state baseline.json
--verify --json` validates an existing baseline without rewriting it.

The reported inventory explicitly excludes the target root `.rustc_info.json`
compiler-query cache from usefulness. Cargo fingerprints compiler and wrapper
paths, file lengths, creation times, and modification times in this file;
relocating an MBX shim can therefore rewrite it during a fully fresh build.
The file remains captured and restored with its original bytes and timestamps.
This is a qualification about compiled actions, predictions, and Cargo unit
state, rather than all compiler-probe metadata. See the pinned
[Cargo compiler-query cache implementation](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/797e8a9bca276c1c9f9f738d2a20f484fa4eea9d/src/cargo/util/rustc.rs#L327-L347).

Workspace transport currently records only the Cargo target directory. A
configured intermediate build directory outside that target is not included;
this API does not qualify restoration of that separate scheduler state. The
JSON report states `workspace_transport_scope: "recorded_target_directory_only"`.

Comparison exports retain the baseline's full action closure and prediction
mappings. Current predictions replace older entries for the same task and
invocation. Captured workspaces replace the baseline state for the same recorded
workspace root; omitted roots remain included. Every retained CAS object is
revalidated. Missing or corrupt retained state fails before publication or group
receipt cleanup.

An additive comparison snapshot must fit the configured action-store budget
(`gc.max_size`, resolved internally to `Config.gc.max_bytes`); the owner measures its verified logical closure before copying
it. An oversized optional snapshot returns an explicit refusal with the budget
and actual byte count, publishes no bundle, and preserves its pending receipts.
This does not certify persistence. Existing store GC may remove old unrooted
baseline objects; their absence causes refusal rather than silently dropping
previously useful work. Baseline integrity covers attachment references as well
as action and semantic workspace inventories.
