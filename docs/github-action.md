# GitHub Action

[`jdx/mr-boxington-action`](https://github.com/jdx/mr-boxington-action)
installs or reuses mbx and configures caching for the job. Start with the default
GitHub backend; use a cache server or bucket when you need object sharing across
runners.
The [action repository](https://github.com/jdx/mr-boxington-action) owns the
complete input reference.

## Start with a complete workflow

Save this as `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. It uses the runner's Rust toolchain;
add your toolchain installation step before the cache action if you pin one.

```yaml
name: ci

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - uses: jdx/mr-boxington-action@v1
      - run: mbx test --workspace
```

The push to `main` fills the archive for later runs. Pull requests restore it
without saving new entries. Most examples below are snippets for an existing
job's `steps` list.

## Read the CI summary

mbx automatically uses its explanatory CI build summary in GitHub Actions and
skips local first-run onboarding. The summary describes mbx's **object cache**;
it does not count artifacts Cargo reused directly from the restored target
directory or the action's archive downloads and uploads. The action reports
archive restore/save results separately. Use `MBX_SUMMARY=short`, `full`, or
`off` to override the default; see [build summaries](/configuration#build-summaries).

## GitHub Actions cache

The default backend restores a pruned Cargo target directory and registry from
a compatible archive. Cargo can then reuse its own fresh outputs. A new
immutable entry is saved after a push to the default branch, or a trusted
`workflow_dispatch` run when `save-on-workflow-dispatch` is enabled. Pull
requests, including forks, are restore-only.

The action manages target placement for this archive mode. Local defaults for
managed targets and link caching may be overridden by the transport; inspect
the action's inputs before assuming a local configuration applies unchanged.

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read

steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v7
  - uses: jdx/mr-boxington-action@v1
  - run: mbx test --workspace
```

Use `github-cache-mode: objects` when several target directories or checkout
layouts need to share one entry. This mode exports the actions used or produced
by the job and omits the Cargo registry. Cargo may need to download crates
again unless you cache those downloads separately.

```yaml
- uses: jdx/mr-boxington-action@v1
  with:
    github-cache-mode: objects
```

Change `cache-generation` when a format or policy change should start a new
archive series:

```yaml
- uses: jdx/mr-boxington-action@v1
  with:
    cache-generation: v2
```

### Match the toolchain

Generated keys cover the operating system, the architecture, and the identity
of the `rustc` on `PATH`, because a store built by one compiler matches nothing
under another. Install the toolchain before the action, and name it in the
action's `toolchain` input when the build selects its own, as `mbx +1.91 check`
does. Advanced workflows can provide complete `cache-key` and `restore-keys`
inputs. The `toolchain` input scopes the key; it does not install or select
the toolchain for the build.

## Parallel Cargo steps

Run multiple Cargo builds at the same time by starting independent lint or
test configurations together using GitHub's
[`parallel` step group](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#jobsjob_idstepsparallel).
mbx gives every compiler they launch one
machine-wide CPU and memory budget:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v7
  - uses: jdx/mr-boxington-action@v1
  - parallel:
      - name: Clippy with default features
        env:
          CARGO_TARGET_DIR: ${{ runner.temp }}/clippy-default
        run: mbx clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
      - name: Clippy with all features and targets
        env:
          CARGO_TARGET_DIR: ${{ runner.temp }}/clippy-all
        run: mbx clippy --workspace --all-features --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Each command needs a separate `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`; otherwise Cargo's target
directory lock serializes the parallel steps. The mbx store and scheduler stay
shared, so the steps run side by side on one CPU and memory budget instead of
each Cargo process filling the runner on its own.

Measure the complete job on your workload. See [Parallel builds](/scheduling)
for tuning and [Benchmarks](/benchmarks#six-parallel-jobs) for a measured batch.

## Docker builds

Mount the mbx store and Cargo registry into the container at stable locations.
The registry may either be mounted directly at `$CARGO_HOME/registry` or
mounted elsewhere and symlinked from there:

```sh
docker run --rm \
  --env CARGO_HOME=/tmp/cargo-home \
  --env HOME=/tmp/build-home \
  --mount "type=bind,source=$HOME/.cargo/registry,target=/tmp/host-cargo-registry" \
  --mount "type=bind,source=$HOME/.cache/mbx,target=/tmp/build-home/.cache/mbx" \
  builder \
  sh -c 'mkdir -p "$CARGO_HOME" && ln -s /tmp/host-cargo-registry "$CARGO_HOME/registry" && mbx build'
```

mbx maps the registry separately from the rest of `CARGO_HOME`, so cached
compiler inputs remain portable when that child symlink resolves outside the
Cargo home directory.

### cargo-chef

`cargo chef cook` creates its skeleton workspace itself, so in a fresh build
stage it starts in a directory with no `Cargo.toml`. The Cargo shim finds no
manifest, hands the command to real Cargo without a cache session, and the build
cargo-chef starts through `$CARGO` never reaches mbx. The cook then compiles every
unit on every run, and mbx prints `no Cargo manifest in scope` to say so.

Write the skeleton first, so the cook starts with a manifest in scope:

```sh
cargo chef cook --no-build --recipe-path recipe.json
cargo chef cook --recipe-path recipe.json
```

The second command runs inside an mbx session and caches the dependency
compilations like any other build.

## Closure bundles for action transports

An action can transport only the cache entries produced or used by its builds,
instead of archiving the whole local store. Every completed `mbx` command
writes an immutable receipt into the group named by `MBX_CACHE_EXPORT_GROUP`,
including commands running in parallel or in different checkouts.
`jdx/mr-boxington-action` sets that group itself; another transport assigns a
unique opaque value for the job before any build steps run.

A restore phase imports a previously cached bundle:

```console
mbx cache import "$RUNNER_TEMP/mbx-cache.tar"
```

The bundle also carries Cargo's scheduler state for each recorded workspace.
When import runs from a matching checkout whose target directory is absent or
empty, mbx restores the fingerprints, dep-info, build-script state, and target
layout alongside the action closure. Large compiler outputs remain CAS objects
and are reflinked or copied into that layout rather than stored twice. Import
leaves a non-empty target directory untouched.

A post phase exports the deduplicated closure of every receipt in this job:

```console
mbx cache export --group "$MBX_CACHE_EXPORT_GROUP" "$RUNNER_TEMP/mbx-cache.tar"
```

The group should include the run attempt, job, and matrix identity, or be a
fresh random value generated for the run. It identifies builds within one job.
It is not the GitHub Actions cache key. A post step should skip saving when no
completed build was recorded or when the workflow's trust policy forbids a
cache write.

## Manual GitHub cache setup

The equivalent pieces can be assembled directly when Cargo download caches or
custom save policies need to share the same entry:

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v6
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.cargo/registry
      ~/.cargo/git
      ~/.cargo/.global-cache
      ~/.cache/mbx
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ runner.arch }}-mbx-${{ github.sha }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-${{ runner.arch }}-mbx-
- uses: jdx/mise-action@v4
  with:
    cache: false
    install_args: mr-boxington
- run: mbx test --workspace
- run: mbx gc --max-size 3GB
  if: always()
```

Use `actions/cache/restore` instead of `actions/cache` in pull requests so the restore action does not also save an entry. Storage permissions and
workflow trust still determine what code in the job can access.

::: tip Pin actions in production
The examples use major tags for readability. Pin third-party actions to full
commit SHAs in a real workflow.

## Cache server

For trusted runners and teams, mbx can talk to a compatible remote server such
as the self-hostable [cache server](/cache-server). The action exports the
remote configuration for subsequent steps:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write

steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v7
  - uses: jdx/mr-boxington-action@v1
    with:
      backend: remote
      remote-url: https://cache.example.com
      namespace: acme/backend
      oidc-audience: mbx-cache
  - run: mbx build --workspace --all-features
```

Only a push to a protected branch may write. Pull requests and tag or release
builds degrade to read-only. If fork authors must not reach the host, use the
GitHub backend for those jobs instead. A bearer token can be supplied with the
action's `token` input when OIDC is unavailable.

## S3-compatible bucket

A bucket needs nothing running.
[`aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials)
exchanges the runner's OIDC token for a role and exports the credentials mbx
reads, so no long-lived secret is stored:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write

steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v7
  - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v6
    with:
      role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/mbx-cache
      aws-region: us-west-2
  - uses: jdx/mr-boxington-action@v1
    with:
      backend: remote
      remote-url: s3://acme-build-cache
      namespace: acme/backend
  - run: mbx build --workspace --all-features
```

The `remote` backend keeps any `MBX_REMOTE_*` setting an earlier step exported
and has no input for, so a step that already points mbx at a bucket needs only
`backend: remote`. It fails the step when mbx finds no remote configured
anywhere, which catches a configuring step that runs too late.

mbx still refuses to publish from a pull request. A bucket has no server to
authorize anything, so make IAM agree: scope the role's trust policy to the
branches allowed to assume it, and give pull request jobs a role that can only
read. See [remote cache](/remote-cache#who-may-publish).

## Production releases

::: warning Keep published artifacts independent of remote compiler caches
A production release may still use `mbx` and its local cache, but should not use
a remote cache so a cache-poisoning attack cannot influence published artifacts.
Release jobs should also avoid restoring or saving compiler outputs through
`actions/cache` or the GitHub backend. The client's tag/release write restriction
does not disable remote reads automatically: remove remote configuration and
archive restore steps explicitly.

the GitHub cache for fork pull requests, see
