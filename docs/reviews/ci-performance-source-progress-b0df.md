# Source-bound progress at b0df793

Status: bounded evidence only. Source-only publication and successful individual
jobs do not qualify tool execution, generator runtime, cross-run reuse or consumer
performance. The [completion ledger](ci-performance-completion-ledger.md) retains
all47 INCOMPLETE statuses and all C01–C09/T01–T26 gates. Earlier waivers and
explicit unavailable observations retain their separate recorded scope.

The observed path Plan → orchestrator → Required spans 270 s from run creation
`05:25:22Z` to Required completion `05:29:52Z`; inter-job waits are 6 and 3 s.
This is a timestamped failed-run interval, including queue, not a qualified warm
budget. Orchestrator passed test identities equal the earlier 1dcd attempt;
unsafe-manifest case suite remains present. Observations 551.061 / 57.898 / 61.379 s
come from different hosted runners/source revisions and remain unpaired.
CPU features/count, separate link time and actual hosted optimization flags are
unavailable; tested Cargo bytes declare SHA2 test optimization level 3.

## Sealed source publication

The terminal two-source transaction finished at `2026-10-03T06:08:17.718581Z`.
Both published releases are immutable, nondraft and nonprerelease, with five
source assets each. Release tags target reviewed generator `c57c700…`.

| Source | Exact source / tree | Actual source release |
|---|---|---|
| Semver checker | `583dddce84706786fc54c41a2c768c28a09c65fd` / `b0f6ea8b85ac0ed288fc29996e441aaa61bbab48` | [402356059](https://github.com/tailrocks/velnor-new/releases/tag/owned-source-semver-checker-583dddce84706786fc54c41a2c768c28a09c65fd) |
| Historical MBX action | `62ec0713473dffeab46884b7c03906042794e696` / `65205f36cd323748e7256d5deb2694b45eb1664a` | [402357500](https://github.com/tailrocks/velnor-new/releases/tag/owned-source-mbx-action-62ec0713473dffeab46884b7c03906042794e696) |

Retained assets are `base.patch`, `source-publication.json`, `source-receipt.json`,
`source.commit` and `source.tar`. Final ten downloaded byte hashes, sizes and asset
IDs match the frozen records. Source APIs bind full trees of 1814 and 51 files,
with eight and six workflow blobs. Observed source-SHA Actions counts are zero;
latest remains `v0.1.0` / `401790118`. Main/tag rules and immutable-release policy
remain unchanged; this is source publication evidence, not retroactive provenance.

Terminal private `terminal-receipt.json` under
`/var/folders/8p/h376l_nn3375kyj72czdq2x80000gn/T/velnor-two-source-authorized-execution-uc6goexe/`
has SHA256 `3caf51792ecc15f7384d2a0e9f5d6df7155c849a9bc6db3bbb0767bd3d5a27d0`.
It binds 1345 files and 422 raw command records; independent rehash found zero
file mismatches. Parent/source Git metadata guards remained unchanged through
the sealed transaction. Internal GH POST/PATCH response bodies were not separately
retained; exact reviewed CLI argv/stdout/stderr/exit, API poststates and downloads
remain recorded. Source-only authority grants no SDK, host, profile, native,
behavioral qualification, signed build provenance or generator release.

Independent frozen-capture reviews bind Semver receipt SHA256
`66bdb0e2aafcd5709b295f49017a7c2ae3085a07a644413b87102e68edf7cbe3`
and historical MBX62 receipt SHA256
`074c32b1031a6288422b6088cd517234407b274c00da187e3bec3c7e9e83c80c`.
Both replay actual downloaded source/archive proofs. Final independent terminal
join `receipt.json` under `velnor-independent-two-source-terminal-4n3e463p/`
in the same private temporary root has SHA256
`5fbdd15fdbe34fb3564c71aecf7e7e1d216c08eafb5bd299a0fde926cc62ad5c`.
It verifies all 1345 files, 422 raw records, four authorized top-level mutations,
ten final downloads and captured historical metadata equality. This offline join
performs no live repository reads and approves no later MBX source or runtime.
