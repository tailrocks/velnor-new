//! The per-compilation event stream `mbx tui` watches.
//!
//! The end-of-build summary says what a build did once the build is over. It
//! cannot say what a build is doing now, and it cannot say which crate any of
//! its numbers belonged to. This module writes the decisions themselves, as
//! they are made, so another process can read them.
//!
//! ```text
//! <store>/sessions/v1/<session>.jsonl   one line per decision
//! <store>/sessions/v1/<session>.lock    held for as long as the build runs
//! ```
//!
//! mbx has no daemon, so a session identifies itself by holding that lock:
//! whoever can take it is looking at a build that is over, however the build
//! ended. A file whose last line is not [`SessionEvent::SessionFinished`] and
//! whose lock is free belongs to a build that died.
//!
//! Events are history, not cache content: nothing keys on them, the collector
//! removes them on age and count alone, and every failure here is reported once
//! and then ignored -- a build is never worth failing over its own telemetry.
