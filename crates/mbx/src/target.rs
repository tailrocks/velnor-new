//! Managed target directories.
//!
//! Cargo puts build outputs in `<workspace>/target`, which means a checkout's
//! outputs live and die with the checkout, and nothing but `rm -rf` ever
//! reclaims them. A managed target directory moves them under a root mbx owns,
//! keyed by the checkout that builds there, and leaves a symlink behind so the
//! paths people type still work.
//!
//! What that buys is collection. A target directory whose checkout no longer
//! exists is unambiguous garbage -- nothing can ever ask for it again -- and it
//! is usually the largest thing on the disk by an order of magnitude. It costs
//! nothing in cache hits: the shim maps the target directory to `${target}`
//! before anything else, so an action keys the same wherever its outputs land.
//!
//! ```text
//! <root>/v1/<digest of the workspace root>/       the target directory itself
//! <root>/v1/<digest of the workspace root>.json   which checkout it belongs to
//! <root>/v1/<digest of the workspace root>.lock   held shared by every command using the directory
//! ```
//!
//! The record sits beside the directory rather than inside it because `cargo
//! clean` empties the directory, and a target directory nothing can trace back
//! to a checkout could never be collected.
//!
//! The lock file is the view's usage lease. Every `mbx cargo` command that may
//! use the directory holds it shared from before placement until the command
//! exits, which covers tests, benchmarks and the program `cargo run` starts as
//! well as compilation. Collection and `mbx clean` must take it exclusively,
//! without waiting, before they move a directory aside, so a view in use is
//! never removed. The file sits beside the directory for the same reason as
//! the record, and because Windows refuses to rename a directory while a file
//! inside it is open. It is never deleted: a command may have opened it but
//! not yet locked it, and unlinking it then would let that command lock a file
//! nobody else can find. Cargo's own `.cargo-lock` and the record refresh at
//! placement still count as in use, for a build that runs Cargo directly
//! through the `target` link and so takes no lease.
