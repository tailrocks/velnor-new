//! Identity of the toolchain that links a native program.
//!
//! rustc hands a native link to a driver -- `cc` on the platforms this tier
//! admits -- which chooses the real linker, the startup objects, and on macOS
//! the SDK. None of that appears in rustc dep-info, so a link is only
//! cacheable once it does appear in the key.
//!
//! What enters the key is identity rather than content wherever a compiler's
//! own identity is: `cc --version` names a toolchain as precisely as
//! `rustc -vV` names rustc, and far more cheaply than hashing the binary. The
//! startup objects are hashed instead, because nothing else pins the libc a
//! link resolves against.
