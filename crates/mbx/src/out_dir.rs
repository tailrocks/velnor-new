//! A stable `OUT_DIR` for compilations that read build-script output.
//!
//! Cargo hands rustc an `OUT_DIR` under the checkout's target directory, and a
//! crate that includes generated sources reads the value through `env!`. That
//! puts the checkout's path into the artifact whenever the crate keeps the
//! value, and into the action key either way, so the crate compiles again in
//! every new checkout even though its generated sources are byte for byte the
//! same.
//!
//! Nothing available to the shim can prove an artifact ignores the path, so
//! the key must not pretend it does. What the shim can do is give every
//! checkout the *same* path: the generated tree is copied under the cache into
//! a directory named for a digest of its contents, and rustc is run with that
//! directory as `OUT_DIR`. Two checkouts whose build scripts produced the same
//! bytes then hand rustc the same string, and whatever the crate derives from
//! it -- a constant, a length, a hash -- agrees by construction. A tree that
//! differs, because the script wrote the checkout's path into it, gets a
//! different digest and a different key, which is the miss it deserves.
//!
//! The copy is only made for a crate whose own sources mention `OUT_DIR`. The
//! test is deliberately cheap and one-sided: a crate that mentions it without
//! reading it costs one copy and nothing else, since the key never sees an
//! environment value the compilation did not read; a crate that reads it
//! through a source the scan cannot see keeps today's checkout-specific key,
//! which is sound.
