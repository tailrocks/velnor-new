//! Protocol and storage primitives for mbx build caches.
//!
//! This crate contains the types shared by cache clients, the task-scoped
//! cache agent, and remote cache implementations. Protocol records are
//! serialized with [`canonical_json`] before hashing; changing their shape is
//! therefore a wire-format change, not merely an implementation detail.
//!
//! Most consumers start with [`CacheDigest`] and the local stores
//! [`LocalCas`] and [`LocalActionCache`]. Remote clients use
//! [`RemoteCacheClient`], while mbx's compiler shim communicates with a
//! [`CacheAgent`] using [`AgentRequest`] and [`AgentResponse`].
//!
//! ```
//! use mbx_cache_core::{CacheDigest, canonical_json};

//!     compiler: &'a str,
//!     source: CacheDigest,

//! let bytes = canonical_json(&Key { compiler: "rustc", source })?;
